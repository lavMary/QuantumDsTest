# Regression on the tabular data

#We needed to use RMSE metric to understand the model performance and also provide target prediction based on the proposed features. 
#First of all we needed to install all dependencies and read both of datasets, then check for redundant values. 
#Then we train a model using 'internship_train.csv' dataset and predict using 'internship_hidden_test.csv'. And finally count Root Mean Squared Error.

#For using this project you need to install file named 'task3.
